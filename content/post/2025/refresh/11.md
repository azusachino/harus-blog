## journal

- a trip to 戦場ヶ原, it's true that you could find scenic views at Japan in various seasons
- spent quite a lot of time to finish the course of "justice" from professor sandel. -- **to think in frameworks, not dogmas**
  - Kant's universal law
  - Rawls's justice as fairness
  - Aristotle's virtue ethics
- we ran twice to finish one loop of the yamanote line in the style of half-marathon, as you could see in the front-page. (they were also my first, second half-marathon)
- I failed to do quite a lot of things, the piano was hardly touched, also the games I bought, and the textbooks stayed at my shelf since ever...
- but rather, I kept a good sleep routine, 6~7 hours in the night, aside the duration, all other metrics were near full score frequently

## conclusion

adapt, and be adept.

we are human capital, and the education is the only short-cut to "success" (having more value than others)?

```ad-warning
**Weiss's most devastating analysis**: Education as investment

**The promise**:

- Invest in education (yours, your children's)
- Education = human capital
- Human capital = good job, security, advancement
- Meritocracy rewards investment

**The reality**:

- Education is POSITIONAL GOOD (value comes from having more than others)
- Everyone investing → credentials inflate → need MORE education
- Bachelor's → Master's → PhD → certificates → lifelong learning
- Treadmill speeds up, never reaches destination
- Student debt = mortgage on your future self
```
