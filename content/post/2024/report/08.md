It's my first time to spend the whole weekend for focus and learning a single topic, which is AWS, even though I didn't make much progress, but this experience itself was far better than the old days when I was always slacking.

## Entertainment

### Haikyu S3

It's all about the final fight between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa, the final boss in MiyajoKen.

Keep learning, keep practicing, keep discovering new-self. That might be the reason they win.

## Learning

### AWS

Always been learning AWS this month.

## life

- checked the aws-sap-pdf the second time, even only a week passed, I simply found so many new concepts, Q-Q
- the library in japan is not bad, free to enter, special seat only for computer use with power. A fair enough good place to study
- another yakiniku this month, kinda really `beefy` in this Feb

## Sharing

As long as I wake up rested and have a sense of control over how I spend my day, I'm feeling great.

### School is not enough

Before you grasp, you have to reach.

Our era is resource-rich, including educational resources, but onramp poor. the legwork is up to you.

The purpose of education is to develop agency within a child. Purposeful work and achieving mastery are tools to getting there. They aren’t the results of learning and imagination, it’s the other way around—learning is simply the consequence of doing. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters genius and talent.
