Separate the work and life?

## Entertainment

### Fallout 4

A great game, I think. Especially when I could set to easy mode, except for the beast, no one can hold me up. Well, until I met some tough guys carried with gun.

After I checked the trophy guide from PSNProfile, I started to learn that it's very hard to achieve the platinum. So I would aim to clear the story for now.

## Learning

### nsenter

I did few challenges from iximiuz courses, the one of finding out the container ip really costed me a lot of times, because there was no relative cmd in the container. And after such a long time not reaching out cloud-native stuffs, I hardly could recall any approach.

Even after I find the cmd of `nsenter`, because of the unfamiliarity, I spent quite a lot of time to really get into the network namespace, by using the option of `-t`.

`nsenter -t pid -n`

## Life

- a pure indoor-ha right now, why bother getting out
- spent pretty much time on games this week in spite of I already stopped to play other mobile games
- the 祭りと花火大会 was a bit disappointing, nothing like the performance from animations

## Collectibles
