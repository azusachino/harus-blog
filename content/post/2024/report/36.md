Real life had so many different faces, and you would only know several of them.

## Entertainment

### Uma girls?

it's kinda sad to see the second season, all the fractures are happened so easily and frequently and without any context or hint, which makes me so confused. And, yeah...yeah, I know all the difficulties are to set off the last scene, the third-fractured uma girl winning the grand price as it's the appointment between the TWO. But, you know, stories like this were plenty, there were nothing new.

And, you know, there were no background story for those uma girls (so far as my perception), if you were born as an uma girl, there was only one fate waiting for you, to run for the prize and entertain the audiences until you can't run at all. Q_Q (the nudge in social value and the so-called educational system, they were setted up for only one purpose, didn't you get it?)
