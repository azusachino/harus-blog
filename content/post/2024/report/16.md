the true belief is elixir and also curse.

## Entertainment

### karaoke

It's been such a long time from we had chance to meet together and sing all day.

And it's really a good place to get yourself far from the everyday life, simply enjoying your song and thinking about the next one.

## Learning

Not much, I wasted a lot of time.

## Life

- I don't know, but it may be kinda melancholy to see one relocate back to China
- and, life sometimes will be super hard, if you don't have any one could back you up
  - because we don't have any acquiantances before we come to Japan, so everything were depending on ourselves
  - it's so funny for us to bring the furnitures from his apartment to mine by our own hands without vechicles
- I start to think "go to gym" is kinda wasting time, but at the same time, I spend more time on electricity devices
- I was too tired in the weekdays, too free in the weekends, there were the excuses I told myself for not to contribute more to learning.
