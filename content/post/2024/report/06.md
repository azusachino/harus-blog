Consistent is the key to live a better life. Or you could simply treat now as it is.

## Entertainment

Also, the bling-bang-bang-born was really `brain-washing`, you heard the rhythm, you start to dance, it's just that simple.

### Lucky Star

Even though, it's an animation from old 2007 days, but it still quite prevail, I think. `Konachan` was kinda the symbol character of `Otaku`, just like my colleague, who is still a `Otaku` right now, and advocates him characteristic every day.

## Learning

well, nothing important to point out.

## life

- Happy Loong Year (mocking face)
- and who would like the emotional damage from the ones you are familiar; only the ones you care can hurt you more deeply
- `wagyu` was really GOOD

## Sharing

### Wonder

  - Everyday, stay guard at the door of your mind

  - an amazing adaption of rabbit-hole (deco\*27)

### Inhabiting tactics

- setting bad goals
- procrastination
- indulging in temptations and distractions
- poor time management

### Psychological Roadblocks

- laziness and lack of discipline
- fear of judgement, rejection and failure
- perfectionism out of insecurity
- lack of self-awareness

### 个人价值

你对自己的了解、肯定与认可，你对自我修行和成长的追求，或是哪怕你修炼在最悲苦的绝境里对自己深深地慈悲、同情、信任与祝福，和钻研延年益寿、快乐豁达的养生之道都是任谁想拿都拿不走的最强兵器库和镇宅之宝。

1. 尽自己最大努力去做事
2. 享受过程
3. 照顾好自己的身体和心理健康

**如果未经你的允许，他人没有伤害你的能力。**
