> If your life is not going well, perhaps it is your current knowledge that is insufficient, not life itself.

## Entertainment

### [キルミーベイベー](https://anilist.co/anime/11079/)

simple and entertaining animation from old (2012) days, and the signature meme-dance from the ed.

I would recommend if you have some thing todo while you can peer the TV sometimes, say acquiring some boring trophies.

## Learning

### AWS

The professional part is real, and I lack all those experiences to solve (example) problems.

Well, the first thing I need finish is, to remember all the critical components in AWS, their functionalities and restrictions.

Say, `AWS Athena` is strictly bonded with S3, it can only scan data from S3, and there are serval approaches to improve efficiency.

- column-based data (`parquet` format)
- compression
- big files

So, to make use of Athena, we have to think about data-sources of S3, and how to make data compliant.

And as a AWS professional, we also have to remember the approximate price of AWS components, for there would be problems about most cost-save architecture.

## life

- actually, didn't make much progress on AWS
  - it might be true, I did finish the course on `Udemy`, but it's hard to say how many percent of those contents I memorized well and let me use them to solve problem in real life (or just for the certification exam)
  - in the next stage, I will focus on example exam, and those concepts I can't recall when I first see
- the blue archive 3rd year event
  - kinda sad, I'm not familiar with events, got the shopping-ticket too late, didn't make it to buy `shiroko`'s scarf

### Java21 Virtual Threads Dead Lock Problem

Under the hood, the Java Virtual Machine creates a pool of `carrier threads`, which execute your `virtual threads`.

[JEP 444](https://openjdk.org/jeps/444) states that:

> _There are two scenarios in which a virtual thread cannot be unmounted during blocking operations because it is pinned to its carrier:_
>
> _When it executes code inside a synchronized block or method, or When it executes a native method or a foreign function._

### how to english

**你的问题也许不在于你不会说，而在于你没什么话可说。**

If you really did memorize so many IETLS writing examples, then, maybe you could have conversation with native speakers, just take the situation as writing. It's a proof that you can talk in english, and it's important for you to realize this.
