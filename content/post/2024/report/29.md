Step out before being stepped off.

## Entertainment

Dota2 EWC, this tornament was great, Team Quest, they fight through the lower bracket, the beat-down of Team Falcon from Team Liquid, and the untouchable Gaming Gladiators.

### Honkai: Star Rail

Until now, I happened to know I could bind the PS version to new email, so I could play on mobile with same UID (to unlock trohpies without PS consoles), which was very convenient.

I didn't know about the storyline, but the art style was great, and I could auto the combat, warp around. except for the conversation, long and un-skippable, bad culture.

## Learning

### Valkey

Hashes, Lists, Sets composed of just integers, and Sorted Sets, when smaller than a given number of elements, and up to a maximum element size, are encoded in a very memory-efficient way that uses up to 10 times less memory.

```sh
hash-max-listpack-entries 512
hash-max-listpack-value 64
zset-max-listpack-entries 128
zset-max-listpack-value 64
set-max-intset-entries 512
set-max-listpack-entries 128
set-max-listpack-value 64
```

- Valkey has bit and byte level operations: GETRANGE, SETRANGE, GETBIT and SETBIT. Using these commands you can treat the String type as a random access array.
- Small hashes are encoded in a very small space, so you should try representing your data using hashes whenever possible.

## life

- the hot summer in on the scene
- it's a good idea to go to the game center for both exercise and cooler condition?
- so tired all the time, summer sluggish period
- attended the BBQ gathering of TokyoDev, it's far from my expectation
  - people from all over the world, with different age range were here
  - but you could only know the three of them, because of the table size
  - there was no instructions or what, took conversations or just drank
