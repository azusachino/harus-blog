`It's not my business` is a critical strategy to use for us to live through this crazy-as-heck world.

## Entertainment

### Lucky Star

It's not outdated, at all. And there are so many things you can say `Naruhoto`, when you really lived in Japan.

## Learning

still stuck at SAP.

## Life

- when you really are concentrating on something, time simply flies fast
- It's such a relief to find any question you had never met in the practice exam, because you can learn new things or reinforce your memorization to help you hit a better score in the real exam
- always considering the underlying cost from each explanation, and this could also apply to real life
  - can you trust someone's saying while you don't know why that person says that, and with what kind of intentions
  - and remember, absolutely no one would say things for `world peace`, nothing matters while comparing to my own interests

## Sharing

If you don't have time to concentrate and learn something new then spend that time reviewing what you've already learned.
