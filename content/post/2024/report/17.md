If you stayed at home long enough, the place you live in will become irrelevant.

## Entertainment

### Dave the diver

very relaxing causual game, which also makes me think, you have to become some kind of expert before you get old, or else, we don't what kind of life is waiting for you.

## Learning

We could use `datetime`, `calendar` built-in functions to deal with datetime problems in python

- 1154. Day of the Year `datetime(y,m,d).days`
- 1185. Day of the Week `calendar.weekday(year, month, day)`

### classic BFS

```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        st = set(deadends)
        q = deque(["0000"])
        step = 0
        while q:
            sz = len(q)
            for _ in range(sz):
                cur = q.popleft()
                if cur == target:
                    return step

                # skip already visited pattern
                if cur in st:
                    continue
                st.add(cur)

                # next pattern
                for i in range(4):
                    plus, minus = "", ""
                    if cur[i] == "9":
                        plus = cur[:i] + "0" + cur[i + 1 :]
                    else:
                        plus = cur[:i] + str(int(cur[i]) + 1) + cur[i + 1 :]
                    if cur[i] == "0":
                        minus = cur[:i] + "9" + cur[i + 1 :]
                    else:
                        minus = cur[:i] + str(int(cur[i]) - 1) + cur[i + 1 :]
                    if plus not in st:
                        q.append(plus)
                    if minus not in st:
                        q.append(minus)
            step += 1
        return -1
```

## life

- finally eased some nerves, spent a lot of time to play games, or should I?
- the days before and between holiday were always kinda meaningless
  - the study plan was disrupted
  - the working was not progressing
  - the fun was just-so-so
- I'd rather go to office regularly to maintain a more disciplined life pace
