## Entertainment

### POE2

Well, 花了点时间继续玩, 总的来说, 感觉挺受苦的, witch 随从流, 由于随从质量也还没成型, 就导致伤害不是很高, 本身也没办法造成太多伤害, 更难受的是随从没办法指定攻击对象; 也就是说, 遇到能够召唤小怪的 BOSS 时, 就开始菜鸡互挠了.

### 向日葵の教会と長い夏休み

詠ちゃん、かわゆいいい。

## Learning

- Two lectures of `Death` from Yale University (Professor Kagan)
  - 数年前, 已经看完一遍中译版的书, 感觉记忆模糊了, 于是准备重新按照 Online Course 再复习一遍
- ETCD column
  - 看了几个章节, 虽然知识点都能理解, 但掌握起来比较困难, 究其原因是, 对 ETCD 没有太多实操经验, 这块是接下来的重点, 再回头结合材料进行复习

## life

- 年末将至, 工作的节奏基本慢下来了, 上午的时间可以随意安排, 于是也抽出时间来学习了
- 晚上总觉得时间很少, 目前在玩的手游确实有点多, 完成每日任务就要花不少时间
- 于是乎, 晚上基本上没时间去做其他“也许是更想做的”事情了
- 周末也是宅了两天, 确实没啥出门的理由, 玩玩游戏也挺舒服.

if we try to resolve the name hello, here is what will happen:

- first, we look for `hello.example.com`
- if that name doesn't exist, we look for `hello.example.net`
- if that name doesn't exist, we look for `hello`
- if that name doesn't exist, we report an error (like `Name or service not known`)

```conf
nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 192.168.1.2
search example.com example.net
```

> By default, only the first name server is used. The other name servers are queried only if the first one times out. This means that all name servers must serve exactly the same records. You cannot have, for instance, one name server for internal domains, and another one for external domains! If you send a query to the first server, and that server replies with “not found” (technically, an NXDOMAIN reply), the second server will not be queried - the “not found” error will be reported right away.

- > What most often weighs you down and brings you misery is the past, in the form of unnecessary attachments, repetitions of tired formulas, and the memory of old victories and defeats. You must consciously wage war against the past and force yourself to react to the present moment…Do not repeat the same tired methods. Sometimes you must force yourself to strike out in new directions…Apply no tactic rigidly…Attack problems from new angles, adapting to the landscape and to what you’re given. -- Robert Greene
