People are simply living in different `worlds`. Reaching a consensus seems nearly impossible.

## Entertainment

### ハイキュー!! ゴミ捨て場の決戦

A fight bonds to fate. Or it's just a set-up from the author for the story arc.

No matter what, they are the biggest competitors, and also best friends. Through the fight, they do their best, and keep growing and learning. That's the name of `seishun`.

## Learning

Nan, just keep reviewing AWS courses, and prepare for exam.

## Life

- running on the ground is just relaxing, comparing to the treadmill experience

## Sharing

You should have no less than 40% and no more than 70% of the information you need to make that decision. In that range, you have enough information to make an informed choice but no so much intelligent that you lose your resolve and simply stay abreast of the situation.
