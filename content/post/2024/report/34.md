I got the ticket to magical mirai 2024 🎉.

## Entertainment

### Black myth wukong

It's time-consuming to play the game through, so I did watch the montage version of the whole story, not bad, I thought this one was a good adaptation of the journey to the west but with the same old theme, to rebel for freedom or accept the 紧箍咒 to live a `normal` life.

## Learning

may be next time.

## life

- it's my first time to be inside a night club, maybe it's not its usual style, but my first impression was boring, nothing was really interesting enough to have fun or what, and the dancers were some kind of npcs inside GTA game
- and the Night hike event was somehow disappointing, or it's me who couldn't understand the art-style of all this; but the set-list of IOWA was very good, with Blue Archive and Gakuen Idol reference, people were getting so high.

  - 一群名利双收的演员，想象中产阶级的恐惧，扮演劳动人民的艰苦。
  - 电影将这种极端赤贫——同时包括物质和精神上——所致的悲哀与残酷，生搬硬套到城市中产的失业影响里，除了强行煽情之外，看不到任何智力活动的影子，生离死别是重型武器，动不动就拿到拌嘴场景里用，只会变得廉价且矫饰。
  - 画鬼容易画犬难，外卖小哥在生活里的活跃频率太高了，反而没了艺术塑造的想象空间，稍不留神就会露出人工痕迹，纵使做足功课，仍然尽是皮套。
