I'm a SAP now, no more AWS materials.

## Entertainment

### Snow-boarding

It's my first time to go the ski-jo, and I think I actually did a good job?

We stayed two days, and I'm able to complete a 2-km route without falling down once. Even though, It's still hard for me to slide stright without intending to slow down, because of the fear of high speed, which might make me out of speed and maybe fall down heavily.

## Learning

Was concentrating on the last preparation for SAP. from next week, will focus more on DSA, and other interesting topics.

## life

- I don't have too much confident after finishing the SAP exam, there are a few multi-options questions I'm not sure, and Even though I spend almost all the time, but just couldn't figure out which ones might be the correct answer, the ambiguous statements, over-simplified question.
- But, what a relief when I receive the congratulation email, and I don't have to re-re-review those for-exam materials any more.
- It's very enjoyable to go on a trip without worrying anything, all you have to do is eat, sleep and play(dance).

## Sharing

Whenever you reach a dilemma, you shall realize it's again another chance to improve yourself.
