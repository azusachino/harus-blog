世界应该是什么样子的?

## Entertainment

### TLOU part1

这算是二次重制的版本? 基本上属于是白送的奖杯, 既有官方修改器, 亦有 PSPlus 的全程 guide, 整体感受相当不错, 也是近些年游戏的特色了吧, 为了迎合大多数玩家, 摒弃了以往的硬核姿态. 最近其实也买了 PS3 版本的 TLOU 初版, 游戏内容确实没有太多差距, 但奖杯的设置难度截然不同, 需要高难度通关 3 次, 且还需要花大量的时间完成联机内容; 而就现在而言, 已经是无法完成了, PS3 的联机基本上停止服务了. (或许是港服账号、日服游戏的原因?)

  - by supporting recall, the retention of knowledge is enhanced
  - by enhancing self-awareness, learners become more aware of their mental processes and can better understand what they do and do not know
  - by putting learners in controlled adversity, important non-cognitive skills such as resilience and grit can be developed
